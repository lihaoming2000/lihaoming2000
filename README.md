##  Hey, I'm Stephen

I'm a coder at heart, business hacker by trade — currently deep-diving into all things AI infra at Stanford.

###  My tech journey

Before B-school and sales life, I was that guy who:
-  Built a Napster-like file-sharing app in 24 hours (won a quarter million-RMB prize 🏆 to fund my CS graduate degree)
-  Supposed to be a coder but hired by Cisco as a trainee - they bought my soul to get into the dark side of the world. 
-  Launched a Cisco data center switch from $0 to $200M in revenue as a PM
-  Helped Microsoft land Azure in China abd rebuilt engineering teams from 7 to 23.

Still hands-on with:
-  Python, Node.js, Claude + MCP
-  Still on VS to use my monthly MSFT credits -  retirement grant from ex-employer
